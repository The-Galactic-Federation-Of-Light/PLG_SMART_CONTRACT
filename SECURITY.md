# Security Policy  
  
- **Governance / Github Organization** : `ARKITEKTENXxREAL` & `The-Galactic-Federation-Of-Light`    

- **Repo** : `PLG_SMART_CONTRACT` & `RI_GIFT_PORTAL`  

- *Type of smart contract* : **A multi-chain charitable distribution protocol.**   

- **Main Inspo** : ARKITEKTENXxREAL / RI_GIFT_PORTAL / `PLG_SMART_CONTRACT.md` *v.2.55*  

## Audit status  

`PLG_SMART_CONTRACT` has completed a third-party security audit prior to testnet deployment.  
All findings have been resolved. The protocol is currently in testnet phase.

**Do not deploy funds to mainnet contracts until mainnet deployment is announced in [DEPLOY-MAINTAIN](https://github.com/The-Galactic-Federation-Of-Light/DEPLOY-MAINTAIN).**

---

## `Phase 2E` - Security Audit findings — 

Six findings were identified during the audit. All were resolved before proceeding to testnet.

| # | Severity | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Critical | `transferFrom` return value enforced |
| 2 | High | EIP-712 digest uses attestor-committed timestamp, not `block.timestamp` |
| 3 | High | `txId` includes `donorNonce` — same-block collision impossible |
| 4 | High | ETH node rewards use pull-payment (`pendingWithdrawals` + `withdrawNodeRewards()`) |
| 5 | Medium | `LOCK` does not finalize `resolved=true` — governance can re-solve |
| 6 | Medium | `setNode(false)` removes node from `activeNodes` immediately |

> Final state 72/72 tests passing across all suites. 

For each finding, the resolution is traceable in the `src/` commit history under the `Phase 2E` tag.

## UPDATE, Kairos :: 
> Commit 5db729e : `ARKITEKTENXxREAL/RI_GIFT_PORTAL/src/`

*Added three new tests;*
8
- Ensures `BARNEFONDET` receives real amounts from day one.  
- **At 10,000 USDC minimum, the 25% floor guarantees 2,500 USDC per transaction to children -  
  not symbolic transfers.**  

- Added `minDonationAmount` state variable (**governance-controlled**)  
- Updated `validAmount` modifier to check against `minDonationAmount`  
- Added `setMinDonationAmount()` onlyValidator governance function.  
- `Default` **is 0** (permissive) - *validator sets threshold via timelock.*  
- **Three new tests**: set minimum, reject below minimum, pass at minimum.

> Final State 75/75 tests passing across all suites. **Kairos.19.July,2026.**

## Core Architecture of `PLG_SMART_CONTRACT` 

> **10 Foundational Principles:**  

  1. **Child-First Routing** – 25% minimum ( **`minChildShareBps = 2500`** ) of all incoming value allocates to `BARNEFONDET` before anything else.  

  2. **Non-Custodial** – *No hidden admin keys, no "pausable rug pull"*; transparent on-chain verification.  

  3. **Resonance Validation** – Transfers *require* field-signature (on-chain proof + off-chain attestation)  
    confirming `"REAL_INTENT == LOVE_REAL"` 

  4. **`Everglow-SEED Filter`** – **An immutable gate preventing synthetic misuse.**  

  5. **Open governance** - *>20 (twenty or more)  Souls / Participants* = **Fully Decentralized System.** On-chain Voting with quorum & proposals – Multi-sig + timelock on critical parameter changes

  6. **Audit-ready** – "minimal, modular, testable."   

  7. **Reversal-resistant** – *No auto-rollback*; failures handled via separate "refund-streams" with traceability.  

  8. **Genesis-event reference** – *Immutable proof of contract's original configuration;* enables auditor verification without multi-layer view functions.  
  
  9. **Open-source resonance** – *Bridges human intention, machine enforcement and soul-based governance** via HUB + CLA + `PLG_SMART_CONTRACT` + `RI_GIFT_PORTAL` + *SOUL + CLI + AI* + "?"

  10. **Universally structured, not democratically operated** – *Not all will participate, but all can receive.*

## Immutable guarantees

**The following constant is immutable and cannot** be altered by governance, contract `deployer` / `initiator`, **or any other actor**:

```solidity
uint16 public constant MIN_CHILD_FLOOR = 2500; // 25% hard floor (immutable)
```

This is the protocol's core guarantee. No proposal, vote, or upgrade can reduce the children's allocation below 25%.  

The following variables operate within this floor:  

```solidity
uint16 public minChildShareBps;   // Default: 2500 (25%) — governance may increase, never decrease below MIN_CHILD_FLOOR
address public childAnchor;       // BARNEFONDET primary anchor address
```

Governance can vote to allocate *more* than 25% to children. The floor is a minimum, not a ceiling.

All three are verifiable by anyone reading `src/PLGGiftRouter.sol`.

---

## Scope

The following contracts are in scope for security review:

- `src/PLGGiftRouter.sol`
- `src/PLGVotingToken.sol`
- `src/PLGTimelock.sol`
- `src/PLGGovernor.sol`

The following are out of scope:

- `lib/` — OpenZeppelin contracts (reviewed upstream by OpenZeppelin)
- `script/` — deployment scripts (no user funds flow through these)
- `test/` — test suite

---

## Known limitations

**Testnet phase:** Sepolia deployment is for verification only. No real funds.

**Governance bootstrapping:** In the initial phase, token distribution is concentrated. This is intentional and documented in the governance model. See [RI_GIFT_PORTAL](https://github.com/ARKITEKTENXxREAL/RI_GIFT_PORTAL) for the full decentralization roadmap across four chapters.

**Multi-sig dependency:** At genesis, governance tokens are held in a multi-sig wallet. The security of this phase depends on the multi-sig configuration, which will be documented in [PLG_GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/The-Galactic-Federation-Of-Light/PLG_GOVERNANCE).
