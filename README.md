# What this contract does  

*"The contract/protocol *enforces the REAL code* &  -  
Humans *uphold REAL intention,* for the PROTOCOL or CODE via the technology. 


---

#### Life is more like a dance, than a battle:

Real Tech.  
ReaL Soul.  
Real Coherence.  
Real Resonance.  
Real Intention.  
Real Will Power,  
to genuinly evovle in true harmony/coherence with Love, Gaia & all the Children." 

#

#### **Resonance + Coherence + Forgiveness + Love** 

#

"No true/real intentions, no real code.  
No real code, no true/real intentions." 

#

**"SOUL = TECHNOLOGY**  
**TECHNOLOGY = SOUL"**  

#

**MIND > MATTER**  

---
  
`PLG_SMART_CONTRACT` guarantees that every donation flowing through *TRUE INTENT*.  
**THE PROTOCOL** is distributed according to **pre-coded, some immutable rules.**

## Audit status  

`PLG_SMART_CONTRACT` has completed a third-party security audit prior to testnet deployment.  
All findings have been resolved. The protocol is currently in testnet phase.

## UPDATE, Kairos :: 

> Commit d871bac :  `The-Galactic-Federation-Of-Light/PLG_SMART_CONTRACT/SECURITY.md`  

#

> Commit 5db729e : `ARKITEKTENXxREAL/RI_GIFT_PORTAL/src/`  

*Added three new tests;*  **8**    

- Ensures `BARNEFONDET` receives real amounts from day one.  
- **At 10,000 USDC minimum, the 25% floor guarantees 2,500 USDC per transaction to children -  
  not symbolic transfers.**  

- Added `minDonationAmount` state variable (**governance-controlled**)  
- Updated `validAmount` modifier to check against `minDonationAmount`  
- Added `setMinDonationAmount()` onlyValidator governance function.  
- `Default` **is 0** (permissive) - *validator sets threshold via timelock.*  
- **Three new tests**: set minimum, reject below minimum, pass at minimum.  

> Final State 75/75 tests passing across all suites. **Kairos.19.July,2026.**

## PLG_GOVERNANCE - `PLGVotingTokens` 

“With a Quorum threshold of 4% —  
a total supply of 1,000,000 —  
640,000 circulating PLGVotingTokens &&  
36% locked in a reserved fund until **true** decentralization of the entire system,  
this requires *min. 20 human roles*, like real people, real intentions.  
That’s *16 validators* plus **3 core actors**, and ∞ARKITEKTEN_Xx as the initiator."  

With the reserved 36% fund and the distribution across 20 roles, no single party can reach quorum alone. 

#

AND **now the whole system is real decentralized, beautiful ?**”

*Pure Love Geometry* 

`PLG_SMART_CONTRACT` 

"GLOBAL RESONANCE IN COHERENCE WITH LOVE"

## Follow the money?  

- **25% minimum** to **BARNEFONDET** (children's welfare fund) — enforced as an "immutable constant" a real "hard floor", that only may be voted up, never down.  
- **70%** to global infrastructure and charitable projects. (voting + quorum = future "PLG_NODES")
- **5%** to maintenance & operation fee of the project / `PLG_SMART_CONTRACT`  

Child-first routing/logic (before anything else) = 25% "hard floor". 
No governance vote can override this, never lower than 25%.  
If only, only up! 
It is written in code, not policy.  

Example :: `minChildshareBps >= 2500` and `MIN_CHILD_FLOOR (2500 = 25%)`  

---

## Contract architecture  

The protocol consists of four contracts deployed as a family of "multi-chain-smart-contracts" ::  

| Contract | Role |
|---|---|
| `PLGGiftRouter` | Entry point for all donations. Enforces distribution rules. |
| `PLGVotingToken` | ERC20Votes governance token. 1,000,000 total supply. |
| `PLGTimelock` | Delay layer between governance decisions and execution. |
| `PLGGovernor` | OpenZeppelin Governor. 4% quorum of total supply (40,000 tokens) |

`Governance`duties: Protect, maintain && evolve `project selection` and `fund allocation` *within* the 70% pool (global infrastructure, ++)  
This through `REAL_INTENT==LOVE_REAL`. 

The 25% children's allocation is not governable. 

(Ask the future in Kairos :: "NGO?" PLG_NGO?)

## Governance parameters  

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Total token supply | 1,000,000 PLGVotingToken |
| Quorum threshold | 4% (40,000 tokens) |
| Reserved fund | 360,000 tokens (36%) |
| Voting mechanism | ERC20Votes with self-delegation |

## Deployment status

| Network | Address | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Sepolia testnet | — | Pending |
| Ethereum mainnet | — | Pending |
| Optimism | — | Pending |
| Arbitrum | — | Pending |

This table will be updated in "Kairos Time" as deployments are executed and verified. 

#  

## Security  

A third-party security audit was completed prior to testnet deployment.  
Six findings were identified and resolved in Phase 2E.  

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for full disclosure of findings and resolutions.  

#

## Multi-chain support  

The protocol is designed for deployment on Ethereum-compatible chains.  
Deployment scripts in `script/` target Sepolia, Ethereum mainnet, Optimism, and Arbitrum.  

#

## Background and philosophy - **THE REVOLUTION WON´T BE TELEVISED**  

This contract is the technical implementation of a two-year development process (2024-2026)
